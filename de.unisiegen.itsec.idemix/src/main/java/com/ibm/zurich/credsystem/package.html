<p>Package contains fundamential functionality to use the Idemix
anonymous credential system.</p>

<p>Also, the package contains a credential store implementation.
This class manages credentials from different locations and makes them
accessible. This functionality is (strictly speaking) not part of the
Idemix library. It only shows how a credential store could be
implemented and how credentials from the store can be retrieved to make
them accessible to the library in order to compile a proof.</p>

<p>One object used by the credential store it a translator object
that manages the encoding of all elements to values that can be messages
within an Idemix credential. This translator should be used when
retrieving a credential as in the following transactions (e.g., running
the proving protocol) the human-readable value can be presented to the
user instead of the actually encoded value. In addition, when revealing
a value to a verifier, the prover must provide the value whose encoding
is revealed as otherwise the verifier does not get the information it
was looking for.</p>
